<h1>Speedy balletje</h1>
<p>
  After finishing my internship at a company building hypercasual games, I found that I had more ideas in that genre I wanted to utilise. This game is built around speed and designed to be easy to pick up, but hard to master. The dynamically ramping up difficulty gives the game an addictive quality. The difference in skill between simply finishing a level and finishing a level as quickly as you can is large.
